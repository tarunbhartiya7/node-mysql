## Start

`docker compose up -d` to start the database and then `npm start` to start the service.

`docker compose down` to stop and remove the databases.

## Test

`npm test` to run all testcases.

## Improvements

Due to time constraint following things could also be added to improve the application:

- security
- validation
- unit test cases
- eslint
